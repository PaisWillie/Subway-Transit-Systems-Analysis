# Subway Transit Data Analysis: Unearthing Insights with Graph Algorithms

## Project Description

This project is an exploration of graph data structures and their algorithms, utilizing real-world data from subway transit systems. The aim is to analyze and model the transit data as a graph, then implement and run relevant algorithms to extract meaningful insights.

## Objectives

- [ ] Understand and implement graph data structures
- [ ] Apply appropriate graph algorithms to solve real-world problems
- [ ] Use subway transit data to build a model for further analysis
- [ ] Learn and apply data analysis methodologies to interpret results

## Implementation

The project comprises of several Python scripts that implement graph data structures and algorithms. These are applied to subway transit data to model and analyze the complex system.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8 or above
- Pytest
- Flake8

## Results and Interpretation

The results of the project, along with a thorough interpretation, can be found in the [graph_lab.ipynb](graph_lab.ipynb) file in this repository.
